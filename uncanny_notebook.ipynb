    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Article 1.__\tThe Licensor grants the Licensee a limited license to use and evaluate asset X and grant sublicenses among group Y, for use and evaluation, in exchange for a licensing fee. This limited license lasts from DD.MM.YYYY (inclusive) to DD.MM.YYYY (exclusive). The licensing fee in amount of `<Amount>` has to be paid within 5 days after contract formation (signature).\n",

    "* __Article 2.__\t(optional) The (Sub)Licensee is commissioned to publish comments about the use of the product, in exchange for an evaluation fee. This allows publication of comments about the evaluation of *ASSET*. Furthermore, this requires the publication of comments about the evaluation of the *ASSET*. If comments are not given for approval within the license period, the Licensee is in breach of the agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Article 3.__\tThe (Sub)Licensee must not publish comments of the use and evaluation of the Product without the approval of the Licensor; said approval must be obtained before the publication of comments about the evaluation of *ASSET*. If the Licensee publishes results of the evaluation of the Product without approval from the Licensor, the Licensee has 24 h to remove the material from the time of publication. If the time lapses without a removal of the comments of the evaluation, the license is considered breached. If the comments are removed, the previous license previous state is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Article 4.__\tThe Licensor is required to approve or deny the comments within 5 days. Furthermore, the Licensor is required to license on successful contract formation and has to pay an evaluation fee in amount `<Amount>` of to the licensee on successful publication of commissioned comments.\n",

    "* The licensee fails to pay the license fee within 5 days\n",
    "* The license is used outside of the license period\n",
    "* In case of publication without approval or failure to publish in case of commission, the defect is not remedied within 24 H\n",
    "* The licensor unduly delays (longer than 5 days) approval or disapproval of submitted comments\n",
    "* In case of commission, the licensor fails to pay an evaluation fee upon approval of the comments (within 5 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Article 6.__\tThis license terminates automatically if the Licensee, Licensor or a sublicensee breaches this license agreement. In case of a breach by the main Licensee, this entails termination of all sublicensees. A breach of the Licensing Terms obliges the Licensee  or Licensor to pay a fee to Licensor or Licensee respectively for Breach of the Licensing Terms.\n",
